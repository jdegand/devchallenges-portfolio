## Overview

![](devchallenges-portfolio.png)

![](devchallenges-portfolio-mobile.png)

- I used example 2 as my guide.

- I have resisted creating a portfolio for a while now.  Portfolios / Personal Websites can become a timesink that you are *never* satified with.  

- I tried using a progress tag and a label for skill bar.  WAVE tool complains about orphaned label - even when label is linked to id of progress bar.  Apparently, if a label is used not inside a form, this warning is thrown.  

- I have looked into the Github API and may try another porfolio project that incorporates it.  

- I have put down Python, C# and Ruby for a while and need to revisit them in the future.  

- I looked at some of my past projects and found some dead links etc so I need to do a little maintenance of my repos.
